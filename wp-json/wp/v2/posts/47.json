After all, you want people to visit your site and view the content on it. This is where search engine optimization comes in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search Engine Optimization or SEO is basically the process of optimizing your website for search engines like Google or Bing so that when people search for certain keywords, your site pops up on the first page of the search.<br><strong>Is SEO really that important?<\/strong><br>The reason why you run a website is because you want people to be able to visit your site and view its content. Whether you run a business, try to create awareness, or simply want people to take notice, getting people to your site and driving traffic is essential. Now, you can do basic self-promotion or pay to get web ads made to direct people to your site. However, the simplest (and often the cheapest way) to get people to your site is through search engines.<br>Wouldn\u2019t it be pointless if you search for your site on a search engine and find you are on page 10 of the searches? Let\u2019s face it, most people have short attention spans and are probably not going to go all the way to page 10 to search for results. With search engine optimization, you can use keywords, tags, and descriptions to allow search engines to find you faster and allow your site to come up higher on searches.<br><strong>Where to begin?<\/strong><br>One of the things we have to be aware of when we talk about SEO are behaviors that impact search engines. You have to ask yourself:<br>\u2022 How exactly do search engines make money?\u2022 What impacts or influences searches?\u2022 What keywords or phrases are most relevant to my page or site?<br>These questions should actually provide you with a better understanding of SEO and how you should respond to those behaviors. One thing I suggest is reading up on the history of SEO and even of search engines to get a glimpse of how the industry works.<br>You can also check out the article\u00a0The Beginner\u2019s Guide to SEO\u00a0by Moz. Moz is a great resource for anything SEO related, and his article is definitely the best way to start. Going through the guide will give you a better insight given by some of the so-called SEO experts.<br>In short, in order for your site to be relevant, SEO is something you should take the time to learn. There are no shortcuts, but in time, you can ensure that your site will always be at the top of the searches, and search engines will drive lots of traffic to your site \u2013 increasing not only the views but possibly your business\u2019 revenue as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We publish <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/systemsacademy.io\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/systemsacademy.io\" target=\"_blank\">\ud30c\uc6cc\ubcfc\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8<\/a> articles of anywhere between 600\u20132,500 words, depending on subject complexity. 1,500 words is about average  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>how to submit? please visit our web page <a href=\"https:\/\/systemsacademy.io\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/systemsacademy.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/systemsacademy.io<\/a> <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to Self-Learn SEO: The Beginner&#8217;s Guide If you run a website or even write for one, one of the things that you are likely on the lookout for is to have your site or the articles appear on the web searches.
